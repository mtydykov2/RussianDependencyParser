-------------------------------
Version 5.05 (28 February 2014)
-------------------------------
XML input with tagged text in content came out with POS-tags still there,
even if the output format did not specify that.

-------------------------------
Version 5.04 (24 February 2014)
-------------------------------
Introduced default -I format for XML input.

-------------------------------
Version 5.03 (24 February 2014)
-------------------------------
Null terminated strings read with fread.

-------------------------------
Version 5.02 (24 February 2014)
-------------------------------
The -X option, without further option arguments, was not working. Now it does.
If the -I option was used, the program could hang if the input didn't conform
to the -I format.

------------------------------
Version 5.01 (6 January 2014)
------------------------------
No functional changes. Deleted comments that were change notifications and
commented-out code. Made sure that setting PROGMAKEDICT, PROGMAKESUFFIXFLEX or
PROGLEMMATISE has the effect of neutralizing irrelevant code. Only if all three
are defined, all code is compiled, creating a Swiss Army Knive that can 
(1) Create a built-in dictionary
(2) Create an old-style flex rule list 
    (Use the program affixtrain for new style!)
(3) Lemmatise a text.

------------------------------
Version 5.0 (3 January 2014)
------------------------------
When lemmatizing (-L option):
Made #define STREAM 1 work as intended: handle standard input line-wise.
If #define STREAM 0, stdio.h functions are used. In that case, input
MUST come from a named file. (-i option).

stdio.h is not removed everywhere. E.g. makedict functionality (-D option)
still uses fprintf even if STREAM 1 is defined in defines.h.

------------------------------
Version 2.4 (3 March 2005)
------------------------------
Removed (undocumented) requirement that word classes must be capitalised.

------------------------------
Version 2.3 (24 February 2005)
------------------------------
Problem solved with -I option. (input format) 

------------------------------
Version 2.2 (23 February 2005)
------------------------------
Problems with generation of flex rules and dictionary solved.
Addition of $s field (word separator that expands to blank or new line) in -c
format.

------------------------------
Version 2.1 (27 January 2004)
------------------------------
General beautification of code.
Introduction of C++ streams instead of file pointers (optional).
Lemmata can contain uppercase characters.

----------------------------
Version 2.0 (5 January 2004)
----------------------------
Initial version under GPL

-------------------------
Version 1.0 (Autumn 2002)
